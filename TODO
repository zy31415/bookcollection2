The most difficult part of this program is how to track directory change.
My best bet right now is to use multi-threading.
Everytime when I open the program, there will be a thread check the change of 
the directory which happened during the period that the program was not running.
This thread will find out deleted files and newly added files and perhaps
give suggestions on renamed files.

When the program is running, there should be a thread keeping checking
the status of the directory.
